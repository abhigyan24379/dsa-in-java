           ****** MY SUGGESTION ********
    1) Use intelliJ IDE (Community Version)
    2) Make a github account upload your codes as frequent as u can
    3) LinkedIn id is must and post everyday atleast one code
    4) If you are beginner start coding on codechef than move to leetcode and gfg
    5) Listen your seniors
